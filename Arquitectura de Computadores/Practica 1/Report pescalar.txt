Starting initial Placement phase.  REAL time: 2 secs 
The Placer has detected elements in this design that imply a RAM block
structure and will attempt to take advantage of this structure.  To disable this
behavior, you can set the PAR_NOGENRAMBLOCK environment variable.

The Placer builds ram blocks in vertical alignment with respect to "Data In"
and "Write Enable" signals.  This is the best for this device due to it's
routing characteristics.  This alignment is not always the best for all designs
due to different design methodologies.  If you would like the ram blocks
generated to be aligned horizontally set the PAR_HORIZONTAL_RAMBLOCK environment
variable.

This design was run without timing constraints.  It is likely that much better
circuit performance can be obtained by trying either or both of the following:

  - Enabling the Delay Based Cleanup router pass, if not already enabled
  - Supplying timing constraints in the input design
